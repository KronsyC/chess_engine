Samirs Simple Chess Game


--------BUILDING--------

I have provided a couple of precompiled binaries in the binaries/ directory
for win64 and linux64.

If you are using MacOS, you will have to compile the Project yourself.

Sources are located in src/

To manually override the binary used by the application, consult find_bin.py for more info

--------RUNNING-------------
To run the chess game site, you will need the
flask python library
